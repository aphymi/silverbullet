SilverBullet v2 removed a slew of features that were still present in the 0.x series (also known as ‚Äúv1‚Äù). Sadly, we just had to rip the bandaid on this one.

Here are some pointers on what was removed and how to adapt.

# Queries
v2 does not have support for old-style [queries](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Query%20Language) (live queries) anymore. They have been replaced with [[Space Lua/Lua Integrated Query]]. Give the linked page a read, but generally there‚Äôs a few differences:

1. Lua Integrated Queries tend to start with `from index.tag "tag-name"` instead of plain `tag-name`. This is a bit longer, but since whatever comes after `from` is a Lua expression, you can not just query [[Objects]], you can query any Lua table as well in the same way.
2. In the old query language, you access attribute simply by their name, this works in LIQ too, but stylistically it‚Äôs nicer to use either `_.attribute`, or to give the object you‚Äôre iterating over a name, using `from page = index.tag "page"`, for instance.
3. The `=` equals operator is `==` in Lua üòÑ

# Templates
In v1 there were various types of templates:

* [Live Templates](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Live%20Templates) (in `template` blocks)
* [Live Template Widgets](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Live%20Template%20Widgets) (using special [[Frontmatter]]-based hooks)
* [Snippets](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Snippets) (using special [[Frontmatter]]-based hooks)
* [Page Templates](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Page%20Templates) (using special [[Frontmatter]]-based hooks)

_Live templates_ are now better expressed by simply putting `${lua expressions}` in text. Iterating and rendering queries using templates is generally done using the `${template.each(query[[...]], someTemplateExpression)}` pattern.

_Live Template Widgets_ can now be implemented using an event listener:
```lua
event.listen {
  name = "hooks:renderTopWidgets", -- or hooks:renderBottomWidgets
  run = function(e)
    return widget.new {
      markdown = "Showing up at the top"
    }
  end
}
```

See [[^Library/Std/Widgets]] for some examples.

_Snippets_ can be implemented as follows: [[Library/Std/Slash Templates]].

_Page templates_ now work slightly differently: [[^Library/Std/Page Templates]].

# Plugs
Many existing plugs _should_ keep working, but some may need updating.
However, since Space Config is removed. You now specify the plugs you like to use with Space Lua + the [[API/config]] API:

```lua
config.set("plugs", {
  "github:joekrill/silverbullet-treeview/treeview.plug.js"
})
```

After which you run the `Plugs: Update` to download and/or update them. `Plugs: Add` has not been (re)implemented, so you have to do this in code.

# Other changes
* Since no database is kept on the server, you can safely delete any `.silverbullet.db` file from your space ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt used anymore.
* Since space config is no longer a thing, `SETTINGS`  is now gone. Instead the [[CONFIG]] page is now the preferred place to configure things. However, this is just a convention. You can use the `config.set` [[Space Lua]] API in any [[Space Lua]] block.

# Removed features
Certain features have been removed:

* Online mode: v2 is sync mode only, meaning all your content will be synced into your browser. A simpler Online mode may be added back later. If you like to wipe your local content at any time, use the `System: Wipe Client` command.
* [Federation](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Federation)
* [Share](https://v1.silverbullet.md/Plugs/Share) replaced by [[^Library/Std/Export]]
* Space Script: replaced by [[Space Lua]]
* Space Config: replaced by the [[API/config]] APIs.
* Command link syntax (`{[...]})`) replaced by the `${widgets.commandButton(...)}` API.
